  Name: Jacinta McDonald</p>
<p> Goals</p>
<p>The goal of this website is to increase revenue for Slammers beach Volleyball by providing information which promotes the services which are offered to new and existing customers. The customer would like to see a 50% increase in customers each week from the 100 players they currently have. </p>
<p> Success Evaluation</p>
<p>The team sign up on the website will be able to measure the number of new teams signing up at Slammers which will result in additional new players. The number of &quot;hits&quot; which the website receives will provide an idea about the level of interest which the site is creating. </p>
<p> Target Audience</p>
<p>The target audience of the Slammers Beach Volleyball site are both males and females aged fifteen to thirty years of age. This audience will be targeted through bright colours, attention grabbing fonts and a sleek, easy to navigate design. </p>
<p> Site Flowchart</p>
<p>The below site flowchart shows the five pages which will be included in the site. The homepage, rules page, competition leader board, contact us and sign up pages. A sign up complete page is also included which is linked to when the submit button is pressed on the sign up page.

	<h3>What is Beach  Volleyball?</h3>
  <p>Volleyball  is a team sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net. The  object of the game is for each team to send the ball regularly over the net to  ground it on the opponent's court, and to prevent the ball from being grounded  on its own court.</p>
  <p>Volleyball is a sport that is  safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness. Since you don&rsquo;t have to move  around the court too much, it&rsquo;s great for people who want a low-impact sport that  will help them get fit without pushing them to their limit. For those who are a  bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be really  exciting and intense, but there&rsquo;s always a net between you and your opponents. </p>
	<h3>Who Can Play?</h3>
  <p>Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men  and women alike.Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program  should see their doctor first.</p>

	<h3>Game Play</h3>
  <p>The ball is put into play by the  right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the net to the  opponent's court. A team is allowed to hit the ball three times (in addition to  the block contact) to return it to the opponent's court. A player is not  allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively, except when attempting a block.  The rally continues until the ball touches the ground/floor, goes  &quot;out&quot; or a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits  a fault.</p>
  <h3>Scoring</h3>
  		<p>The team  winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team  wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate  one position clockwise.The best of  three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be  won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage  (no scoring cap). If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that  first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). </p>
